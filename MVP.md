# Metis Project 4: Credit Card Fraud






The goal of this project is to construct a model that can predict credit card fraud.


To achieve this goal, I constructed a Logistic Regression model that uses transaction data to flag transactions as potentially fraudulent.


First, I placed the data into train/test sets with an 80/20 ratio.

Next, I fit a model to the data as a baseline.


###Confusion Matrix:

| 	           | Predicted Negative     | Predicted Positive |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| True Negative | 1.99      | *7*        |
| True Positive      | **1.89**  | 5234       |
